# data-structures-using-c
1. Data structures and basic implementations from Oxford press "Data structures using c"
2. In this repository data structures and basic implementations will be committed as mentioned above. 
3. I will use basics of c but i will not mind some intermediatary or advanced usages of C because the goal of this repo is learning Data Structures Deeply, not the C language.
4. After completing this repository i will upload Algorithms from another book in an other repository as well.
5. And there may be some graphical visualizations for algorithms too. 
6. In addition, some algorithms will be coded in this repository, like some sorting.
7. Enjoy Coding!
