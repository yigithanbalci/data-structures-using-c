# data-structures-using-c
Data structures and basic implementations from Oxford press "Data structures using c"
In this repository data structures and basic implementations will be committed as mentioned above. 
I will use basics of c but i will not mind some intermediatary or advanced usages of C because the goal of this repo is learning Data Structures Deeply, not the C language.
After completing this repository i will upload Algorithms in an other repository as well.
And there may be some graphical visualizations for algorithms too. 
Enjoy Coding!
